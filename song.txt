Stapled shut, inside an outside world
And I'm sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
I've got no time to lose, I'm just caught up in all the cattle

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fray the strings…
Throw the shapes…
Hold your breath…
Listen!

[Chorus]
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
